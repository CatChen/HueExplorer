## Hue Explorer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CatChen/hue-explorer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CatChen/hue-explorer) [![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/catchen/hue-explorer.svg)](https://david-dm.org/catchen/hue-explorer)

Hue Explorer is a web based tool to help you explore the data in your Philips Hue bridge. These are what you can do with the current version (0.2.0):

1. Discover and connect to local Hue bridges.
2. See all data from the bridge in JSON format.

Here are the things I plan for future versions:

1. Visualize data in a more meaningful way, for example:
  1. Render color values as corresponding colors on screen.
  2. Link data between different views, like show light names instead of light ids in a room.
2. Enable editing of certain data.
3. Support remote (out of home) control of the bridge.

If you want to use it without deploying the code, you can visit [hue-explorer.herokuapp.com](http://hue-explorer.herokuapp.com/).
